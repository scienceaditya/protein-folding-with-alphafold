# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

This experimental framework is designed to systematically test the central hypothesis that BEACH domain proteins function as allosteric switches rather than passive scaffolds. Each experiment targets specific assumptions identified in the literature review and provides computational validation using AI-driven structural prediction and analysis.

**Core Strategy**: Use AlphaFold3 structural predictions combined with computational analysis to challenge three fundamental assumptions about BEACH domain function, moving from static to dynamic understanding of these proteins.

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1: Dynamic Conformational Analysis of BEACH Domains
- **Objective**: Test Assumption 1 - Challenge the static scaffolding model by identifying dynamic conformational states in BEACH domains
- **Hypothesis**: BEACH domains exhibit multiple stable conformational states that correlate with different functional modes
- **Methodology**: 
  - Generate AlphaFold3 structural ensembles for 10 representative BEACH proteins (LYST, NBEAL1, NBEAL2, WDR81, FAN1)
  - Perform molecular dynamics simulations on predicted structures
  - Analyze conformational flexibility using RMSF and principal component analysis
  - Map allosteric networks using dynamic network analysis
- **Dependent Variables**: Conformational RMSF values, principal components, allosteric pathway connectivity
- **Independent Variables**: Protein sequence, domain boundaries, simulation conditions
- **Expected Outcomes**: Identification of 2-3 distinct conformational states per BEACH protein, with hinge regions between domains
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - >2 statistically distinct conformational clusters (p<0.05)
  - RMSF >3Ã… in predicted flexible regions
  - Identification of allosteric pathways connecting BEACH and PH domains
- **Validity Threats**: Limited by AlphaFold prediction accuracy, computational simulation time scales
- **Mitigations**: Cross-validate with existing crystal structures, use multiple MD simulation packages

### Experiment 2: PH-BEACH Allosteric Coupling Network Analysis
- **Objective**: Test Assumption 3 - Demonstrate functional communication between PH and BEACH domains beyond structural stability
- **Hypothesis**: Mutations in PH domain propagate conformational changes to BEACH domain interaction sites through allosteric networks
- **Methodology**:
  - Generate structural models for wild-type and disease-associated mutants of LYST and NBEAL2
  - Apply in silico mutagenesis to PH domain residues
  - Calculate cross-correlation matrices between PH and BEACH domain residues
  - Map allosteric communication pathways using mutual information analysis
  - Predict binding affinity changes for known BEACH protein partners
- **Dependent Variables**: Cross-correlation coefficients, mutual information scores, predicted binding affinities
- **Independent Variables**: Mutation position, mutation type, protein-protein interaction partners
- **Expected Outcomes**: Strong correlation between PH domain mutations and BEACH domain conformational changes
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Cross-correlation >0.6 between PH mutations and BEACH binding sites
  - >70% of disease mutations show disrupted allosteric pathways
  - Predicted binding affinity changes >2-fold for affected interactions
- **Validity Threats**: Computational predictions may not capture real biological interactions
- **Mitigations**: Focus on well-characterized disease mutations, validate against experimental interaction data

### Experiment 3: Functional Diversification Beyond Vesicle Trafficking
- **Objective**: Test Assumption 2 - Identify BEACH protein interactions beyond vesicle trafficking machinery
- **Hypothesis**: BEACH proteins interact with diverse cellular machinery through conserved structural motifs, expanding their functional space
- **Methodology**:
  - Perform structure-based interaction prediction using AlphaFold3 and protein interaction databases
  - Analyze BEACH domain surface properties and identify novel binding motifs
  - Cross-reference predicted interactions with gene expression and co-localization data
  - Map BEACH protein interactions to cellular pathways using pathway enrichment analysis
- **Dependent Variables**: Number of predicted interactions, pathway enrichment scores, binding affinity predictions
- **Independent Variables**: BEACH protein family members, cellular pathway databases, interaction confidence thresholds
- **Expected Outcomes**: Identification of BEACH protein interactions in signal transduction, gene regulation, and metabolic pathways
- **Success Metrics**:
  - >50 novel high-confidence interactions per BEACH protein
  - Significant enrichment (p<0.01) in non-trafficking pathways
  - At least 3 validated interaction categories beyond vesicle trafficking
- **Validity Threats**: False positive predictions, bias toward well-studied pathways
- **Mitigations**: Use multiple prediction algorithms, cross-validate with experimental proteomics data

### Experiment 4: Evolutionary Conservation Analysis of Dynamic Motifs
- **Objective**: Validate the functional importance of identified dynamic regions through evolutionary analysis
- **Hypothesis**: Allosteric sites and dynamic regions in BEACH domains show higher evolutionary conservation than static structural regions
- **Methodology**:
  - Collect BEACH domain sequences from 100+ species across major taxonomic groups
  - Perform multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
  - Calculate conservation scores for each residue position
  - Correlate conservation scores with predicted dynamic regions and allosteric sites
  - Analyze selection pressure using dN/dS ratios
- **Dependent Variables**: Conservation scores, dN/dS ratios, phylogenetic signal strength
- **Independent Variables**: Species selection, alignment parameters, evolutionary distance
- **Expected Outcomes**: Higher conservation in predicted functional sites compared to structural sites
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Conservation scores >0.8 for predicted allosteric sites
  - Significant correlation (r>0.5, p<0.01) between dynamics and conservation
  - Evidence of purifying selection (dN/dS<0.3) in functional regions
- **Validity Threats**: Phylogenetic bias, alignment quality, annotation errors
- **Mitigations**: Use multiple alignment algorithms, validate with curated databases
