# Research Concept & Direction

## Overview

Protein folding research has been guided by fundamental assumptions that may be limiting our understanding and predictive capabilities. This research challenges core assumptions in protein folding, particularly around AlphaFold and deep learning approaches, to unlock new insights into protein structure prediction and design.

**Problem Statement**: Current protein structure prediction methods, while revolutionary, are built on assumptions that may prevent breakthrough discoveries in protein folding mechanisms and limit their applicability to novel protein spaces.

**Research Objectives**:
1. Identify and challenge fundamental assumptions in protein folding literature
2. Develop novel hypotheses that invert these assumptions
3. Design experiments to test these hypotheses using computational and deep learning approaches
4. Advance protein structure prediction beyond current limitations

## Key Research Questions

1. **Static vs Dynamic Structure Assumption**: Does AlphaFold's focus on static structure prediction overlook critical folding dynamics that could improve prediction accuracy?

2. **Data Sufficiency Assumption**: Can we achieve better structure prediction with deliberately limited or biased training data that captures essential folding principles?

3. **Sequence-Structure Determinism**: Are there protein functions achievable through multiple distinct folding pathways, challenging the one-sequence-one-structure paradigm?

4. **Thermodynamic vs Kinetic Control**: Can kinetic folding pathways provide better prediction models than thermodynamic stability-based approaches?

5. **Topology Prediction Limitations**: How can we overcome AlphaFold's documented failures with protein knots, multi-domain orientations, and membrane proteins?

## Methodology

**Computer Science-Inspired Research Framework**:

**Phase 1: Assumption Identification & Hypothesis Generation**
- Systematic literature review to catalog fundamental assumptions
- Generate "assumption-flip" hypotheses using the template: "Prior work assumes X → We propose Y → This matters because Z"
- Prioritize hypotheses based on impact potential and feasibility

**Phase 2: Computational Validation**
- Design targeted experiments to test each hypothesis
- Develop modified AlphaFold architectures incorporating new assumptions
- Create benchmark datasets for novel protein spaces (knotted proteins, membrane proteins, dynamic complexes)

**Phase 3: Empirical Testing**
- Implement proof-of-concept models
- Compare against existing methods on standard and novel benchmarks
- Analyze failure modes to refine hypotheses

**Expected Impact**: This research could reveal new principles of protein folding, improve structure prediction for challenging protein classes, and guide the development of next-generation protein design tools.
